    Giulia Oprea is a second-year American Studies graduate student. They completed their undergraduate work at Cal State Fullerton and received their BA in American Studies. They received their AA in Political Science at Santiago Canyon College, which primed their critical approach to American culture and history. Giuliaâ€™s work is concerned with state power, mainly focusing on a critical approach to institutions of social control like police and prisons, which they examine through an abolitionist, post-colonial, and anti-capitalist lens. They hope to pursue this avenue of research in a PhD program and develop critical theory on the matter.
