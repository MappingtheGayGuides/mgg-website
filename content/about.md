Mapping the Gay Guides is a collaborative project by Dr. Amanda Regan and Dr. Eric Gonzaba.

## Dr. Amanda Regan
Amanda Regan is a historian of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries and is currently a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University’s Center for Presidential History. She earned her PhD in History from George Mason University in 2019.

Her research sits at the intersection of women’s history, fitness history, and history of the body and her work often relies upon computational methodologies as a research tool for examining large corpuses of primary sources and gleaning new insights. Her current book, _Shaping Up: Physical Fitness for Women 1880-1965_, examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest throughout the twentieth century. _Shaping Up_ traces the origins of how fitness became a tool in the repertoire of physical educators, reformers and state actors who sought to shape behavior and inscribe their values onto the female body, often in reaction to various social anxieties throughout the twentieth century. It argues that the fitness and shape of the female body became an issue of interest tailor-made for government intervention well before the modern fitness movement was born.

From 2013 to 2015 Amanda was a Digital History Fellow at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM). Following her fellowship, she continued at RRCHNM where she served as the Software Development Manager for the PressForward Project and as the Managing Editor of _Digital Humanities Now_.

## Dr. Eric Gonzaba

Dr. Eric Gonzaba is an Assistant Professor of American Studies at California State University, Fullerton. He received his doctorate in American History from George Mason University in 2019. A specialist in African American history and LGBT culture, he’s currently completing a book on the culture and politics of gay nightlife in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia since 1970.

Beyond his research, Gonzaba strives to find innovative ways to teach and understand our past, especially through digital public history. In 2014, he founded Wearing Gay History, a digital archiving project documenting the history of modern LGBT communities through t-shirts. The project currently includes over 4,000 historical LGBTQ shirts from over twenty archival facilities across the globe and showcases the dynamic history of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans people across local and national boundaries. In 2016, the National Council on Public History awarded Wearing Gay History its top student prize.

When not working on historical projects, Gonzaba enjoys going to the movies, chowing down on popcorn or Japanese food, poorly playing the piano, reading his favorite authors (Langston Hughes, Nora Eprhon, Truman Capote, & Zora Neale Hurston), or attempting to best his friends and family while watching Jeopardy.

And on particularly stressful days, you can find him re-watching his favorite movie that has never failed to cheer him up: The Birdcage.
