_Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG)_, is a collaborative mapping project by [Dr. Amanda Regan](http://www.amanda-regan.com) and [Dr. Eric Gonzaba](http://ericnolangonzaba.net) that draws on the Damron Guides, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s. An LGBT equivalent to the African American “green books,” the Damron Guides contained lists of bars, bathhouses, cinemas, hotels and cruising sites in every U.S. state. MGG seeks to associate geographical coordinates with each location mentioned within the Damron Guides and provide an interface for visualizing the growth. Made up of a public-facing and freely available web app as well as a series of digital vignettes that analyze the data using historical context, MGG stands to make a significant contribution to scholars understanding of the ways in which LGBTQ people negotiated and appropriated public space to form community.

This project is a work in progress. Please check back soon. You can follow us at [@gayguides](https://twitter.com/gayguides) on Twitter to be notified when we launch.
