Today we're so excited to formally launch a map and complete dataset of all U.S. locations listed in Bob Damron's Address Book from 1965-1980! In February 2020 we launched with just the U.S. South and since then we've been slowly rolling out additional states. Today we are adding more than twenty states to complete our dataset!

Users can now use our [map](/map) to look at the more than 34,000 entries across this period. Each location has been categorized by our team so that users can explore the growth of types of locations like bathhouses or religious institutions. For example bathhouses see an explosive growth during this period growing from just 22 in 1965 to more than 190 in 1980.

In the coming months we'll be release data for Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands as well as release more vignettes that put the data on this site into context.
