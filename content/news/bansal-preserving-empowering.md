title: "Preserving and empowering LGBTQ+ lives with maps"
author: "Snigdha Bansal"
description: "For LGBTQIA+ people, location data and maps are often less about taking them where they want to go, and more about telling them where they can go. Apart from pointing out safe spaces and those they must avoid; maps also serve as proofs of existence of the queer community â€” especially in a world that repeatedly tries to erase and overwrite their history."
