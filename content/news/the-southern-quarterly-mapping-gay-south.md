title: "Regan and Gonzaba publish 'Mapping the New Gay South: Queer Space and Southern Life, 1965-1980' in The Southern Quarterly"
author: "Amanda Regan and Eric Gonzaba"
description: "In the midst of his presidential reelection campaign in 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson came to a prominent Atlanta Hotel, the Dinkler Plaza, to give a speech in which he proclaimed: "the New South is Here." Asking his audience to recall the condition of the South during the Great Depression and the commitment of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to righting the devastating conditions in the South, Johnson outlined the recent economic successes of the South and the challenges for the future. Invoking Henry Grady, the former editor of the Atlanta Constitution and the man who coined the slogan "the New South," Johnson argued that the South of 1964 was a "South of union and freedom." It was a "South which is living, breathing, growing every hour." (Public Papers of the President of the United States) However, Johnson argued that despite all its successes, the South still had trouble attaining a just society and equality among the races."
