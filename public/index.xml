      <description>The Mapping the Gay Guides team is pleased to announce that we have received a three-year grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support the expansion of Mapping the Gay Guides. This generous support comes from the Humanities Collections and Reference Resources program within the NEH’s Division of Preservation and Access.
  This funding will allow us to expand Mapping the Gay Guides in several ways.
First, it will allow the MGG team to digitize and transcribe another twenty years of data from the Bob Damron Address Books.</description>

      <description>So many of the entries in Bob Damron Address Books appear unremarkable. (I mean, not all bars can have a history like Stonewall, right?) The vast majority of listings in the gay guides don’t provide much context or historical information, and so it requires historians and the wider public to give meaning to these lists of addresses. But even if wider context doesn’t always lead to cinematic stories of police raids or resistance, it doesn’t mean we can’t learn more about queer life in America through these guides.</description>

  In a 1971 article of Queen’s Quarterly, a magazine for “Gay Guys Who Have No Hangups,” San Diego was promoted as the city with “Something for Everyone.”1 For those curious readers, San Diego was promised as a city with little to no harassment for gay men, especially in comparison to the brutal homophobic treatment by police in neighboring Los Angeles.</description>

  At some point during the summer of 2017, I recall that my friends and I wandered into Ripples after leaving Panama Joe’s on Second St in Long Beach, CA. I remember searching for the nearest gay club on Google Maps and being surprised that there was one less than half a mile away, facing the beach. As we turned the corner onto Ocean Boulevard, we looked up at the six flags that sat on top of the club which, together, made a rainbow.</description>

  While entering the data for Damron’s listings, we couldn’t help but notice the fleeting nature of queer spaces; many entries would be listed one year and gone the next. We also couldn’t help but notice a lack of queer spaces for women. Damron’s guide primarily caters to white gay males while occasionally noting some spaces for queer women.</description>

      <title>Paramount Steak House: A Forever Listing</title>

      <guid>http://dev.mappingthegayguides.org/articles/parmount-steakhouse-a-forever-listing/</guid>
      <description>One of the reasons why our team loves this project is because the site helps us understand the queer culture through spaces that no longer make up the modern United States. That is, the vast majority of the listings you’ll see in the Damron Address Books and in our data are spaces that are no longer in operation. Queer businesses, just like non-queer commercial spaces, come and go with the economic times, and thus the bars, baths, theaters, bookstores, restaurants, and other shops located within our data are largely historical records, no longer representing sites still in operation.</description>

  This past week, millions around the world celebrated Mardi Gras, a lively and colorful celebration before the fasting season of Lent. In the United States, the celebration is most closely associated with the parish of New Orleans, the largest municipality in Louisiana. Each year, hundreds of thousands of tourists descend on the Crescent City to enjoy the city’s infectious Dixieland jazz, flavorful cuisine, and of course its storied and often tragic history.</description>

      <description>Today we’re excited to officially launch the first phase of Mapping the Gay Guides.
What is Mapping the Gay Guides?   Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) is a digital mapping project that aims to understand often ignored queer geographies using the Damron Address Books, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s. Similar in function to the green books used by African Americans during the Jim Crow era to help identity businesses that catered to black clients in the South, the Damron Guides aided a generation of queer people to identity sites of community, pleasure, and politics.</description>

He received his doctorate in American History from George Mason University in 2019. A specialist in African American history and LGBT culture, he’s currently completing a book on the culture and politics of gay nightlife in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia since 1970.
Beyond his research, Gonzaba strives to find innovative ways to teach and understand our past, especially through digital public history.</description>

      <description>Creating a Dataset Turning a historical document, such as the Damron Address Books, into data that can be used for mapping is a process fraught with methodological decisions that shape the resulting dataset. The goal of this page is to make visible the choices that were made and clarify our categorization of data.
 Figure 1. Example of typical listings in the Damron Address Book.
  Although the Damron Guides have been digitized up until 1980 they are only available via an academic subscription to the Alexander Street LGBT Thought and Culture database.</description>

      <description>Digital historians have ethical obligations, especially when they work with materials and subject matters that relate to marginalized communities. Since this project is centered on the culture of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, the Mapping the Gay Guides team strives to make our project ethically responsible, respecting the privacy, perspectives, and dignity of those whose stories are reflected within our work.
The data in Mapping the Gay Guides reflects thousands of sites important to development of queer (mostly gay male) culture since the 1960s.</description>

  Does Alabama have an LGBTQ history? In her 1997 travel guide The Queerest Places: A Guide to Gay and Lesbian Historic Sites, Paula Martinac provides readers wonderful descriptions of historical places of interest related to queer history. She divides her summaries by states from five regions: New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the West, and the South.</description>
