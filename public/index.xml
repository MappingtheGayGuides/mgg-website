      <description>Today we’re excited to officially launch the first phase of Mapping the Gay Guides.
What is Mapping the Gay Guides?   Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) is a digital mapping project that aims to understand often ignored queer geographies using the Damron Address Books, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s. Similar in function to the green books used by African Americans during the Jim Crow era to help identity businesses that catered to black clients in the South, the Damron Guides aided a generation of queer people to identity sites of community, pleasure, and politics.</description>

      <description>Creating a Dataset Turning a historical document, such as the Damron Address Books, into data that can be used for mapping is a process fraught with methodological decisions that shape the resulting dataset. The goal of this page is to make visible the choices that were made and clarify our categorization of data.
 Figure 1. Example of typical listings in the Damron Address Book.
  Although the Damron Guides have been digitized up until 1980 they are only available via an academic subscription to the Alexander Street LGBT Thought and Culture database.</description>

      <title>A Statement on Ethics</title>

      <description>Digital historians have ethical obligations, especially when they work with materials and subject matters that relate to marginalized communities. Since this project is centered on the culture of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, the Mapping the Gay Guides team strives to make our project ethically responsible, respecting the privacy, perspectives, and dignity of those whose stories are reflected within our work.
The data in Mapping the Gay Guides reflects thousands of sites important to development of queer (mostly gay male) culture since the 1960s.</description>

      <description>No study of the American South (or really any part of the United States) would be complete without a thorough examination of race. In his examination of queer life in Mississippi, historian John Howard reminds us that race has a “pervasive influence &amp;hellip; in all realms of human behavior.”1 In a region of the country when at the first years of our study still suffered through immense apartheid via Jim Crow segregation, we expected to see some trends that reflected the racial dynamics in the burgeoning gay world of the South.</description>

      <description>Figure 1. From Martinac’s The Queerest Places. Despite her excellent coverage of the American South, no Alabama sites are listed.
  Does Alabama have an LGBTQ history? In her 1997 travel guide The Queerest Places: A Guide to Gay and Lesbian Historic Sites, Paula Martinac provides readers wonderful descriptions of historical places of interest related to queer history. She divides her summaries by states from five regions: New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the West, and the South.</description>
