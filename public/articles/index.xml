      <description>One of the reasons why our team loves this project is because the site helps us understand the queer culture through spaces that no longer make up the modern United States. That is, the vast majority of the listings you’ll see in the Damron Address Books and in our data are spaces that are no longer in operation. Queer businesses, just like non-queer commercial spaces, come and go with the economic times, and thus the bars, baths, theaters, bookstores, restaurants, and other shops located within our data are largely historical records, no longer representing sites still in operation.</description>

  This past week, millions around the world celebrated Mardi Gras, a lively and colorful celebration before the fasting season of Lent. In the United States, the celebration is most closely associated with the parish of New Orleans, the largest municipality in Louisiana. Each year, hundreds of thousands of tourists descend on the Crescent City to enjoy the city’s infectious Dixieland jazz, flavorful cuisine, and of course its storied and often tragic history.</description>

      <description>Figure 1. From Martinac’s The Queerest Places. Despite her excellent coverage of the American South, no Alabama sites are listed.
  Does Alabama have an LGBTQ history? In her 1997 travel guide The Queerest Places: A Guide to Gay and Lesbian Historic Sites, Paula Martinac provides readers wonderful descriptions of historical places of interest related to queer history. She divides her summaries by states from five regions: New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the West, and the South.</description>
